## Big kudos to fishlover7!



<br>
Redditor **fishlove7** put in serious work crafting the **Ultimate CompTIA SY0-701 Security+ Study Guide**. The fish's real name? **Christian Joseph Miranda** as it is written in the very first page of a study guide! Please give him a upvote in this [Reddit link][Reddit link]; the guide is included there too.

<br>
There are about **15 lessons** in that study guide with **437 pages**. I will not be noting down everything here. **I blog the key takeaways I think are worth remembering from the study guide.** I will also measure my knowledge by answering all questions from here [ExamCompass][ExamCompass]. As a matter of fact, I will do one right now to see how I do. **I've been a QA for 4 years and a Pen Tester for a year.**

Whelp! I didn't do well. ExamCompass has about 24 different quizzes, each with 25 questions. The actual Security+ exam... its 90 questions in 90 minutes. Basically a minute per question. Most are multiple choices. Some will ask you to select 3 answers out of five which really slows things down.<span style="color:red"> **If got two right and one wrong, then the whole question is counted as wrong.**</span> Gotta to know your stuff to breeze through quickly.

Each Security+ post here will focus on one or few lessons, plus a ExamCompass quiz. I did quiz 1 today and I noted down what I learned from it.
